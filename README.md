## About
University Course Helper is a full-stack CRUD web application developed using React, Node.js and express. The version hosted on this repository uses a MySQL database and is hosted with Heroku and Netlify.

The purpose of this application is to assist University Students in choosing classes by providing information, such as past syllabuses, professors who typically teach the course and the relevance of the course to certain degrees. The website also features a robust rating system, allowing for creation, reporting, editing and deletion of ratings.
