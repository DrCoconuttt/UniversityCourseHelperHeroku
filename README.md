## About
UniversityCourseHelper is a full-stack CRUD web application that enables students to rate their professors. It was developed using React, Node.js and express. The version hosted on this repository uses a MySQL database and is hosted with Heroku and Netlify.

The purpose of this application is to assist University Students in choosing classes by providing information, such as past syllabuses, professors who typically teach the course, and the relevance of the course to attaining certain degrees. The website also features a robust rating system, allowing for creation, reporting, editing and deletion of ratings.
